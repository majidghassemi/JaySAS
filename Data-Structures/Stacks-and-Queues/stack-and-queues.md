# Stack and Queue impelementation

* Both of them are linear Data structure
* We can traverse over these sequentially

* **Stack**
 * In simplest description , the set of plates 
 * LIFO (Last In, First Out)
 * Each item inserted last, the first is out
 * Pop, Push, Peek(Visit The top of stack) Big O is O(1) (*so gooooooood*)
    

* **Queue**
 * Rollercoaster is the best example of this ds
 * Opposite of stack is FIFO (First In, First Out)
 * Each item inserted First, the first is out
 * Pop, Push, Peek Big O is O(1) (*sound good*)
