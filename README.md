This repository contains different approaches for common problems in the programming world such as *caeser's cipher*, *mutations* and etc... on three levels of basic, intermediate and advanced (level depends on problems); for example caesar's cipher included in basic problems .  


**The proposed approaches are also expressed in a few optimal states**.   
   
***  
   

#### Problems covered so far is :   
* Find longest word in string
* [Factorial of number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
* [Palindrome string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)
* Reverse of string
* Find the longest number(s) in array(s)
