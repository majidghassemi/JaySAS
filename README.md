This repository contains different approaches for common problems in the programming world such as *caeser's cipher*, *mutations* and etc... on three levels of basic, intermediate and advanced (level depends on problems); for example caesar's cipher included in basic problems .  


>**The proposed approaches are also expressed in a few optimal states**.
